description: Creates reusable Flocks tools and API integrations. Supports YAML-HTTP for REST APIs and Python for local utilities, with mandatory verification and smoke testing. All output under ~/.flocks/plugins/tools/. When to use: creating or adding a new Flocks tool, building local utilities such as base64 encode-decode, URL encode-decode, JSON formatting, parsing, hashing, text or file transformation, or integrating an external REST API as a reusable tool. Example requests: "Create a base64 encode/decode tool", "Build a URL encode/decode utility", "Add a JSON formatter tool", "Integrate a REST API as a Flocks tool".

# Tool Builder

## Quick Start

When the user asks to create a new tool or integrate an API:
1. Choose the mode
2. Follow the workflow
3. **Run the mandatory verification protocol** (every mode)
4. **Enable the tool immediately after creation** so it is available right away without asking the user to enable it manually

## Activation Requirement

Every tool created with this skill must be usable immediately after the task finishes.

- **YAML tools**: always set `enabled: true`
- **Python tools**: place the file in the correct plugin directory so the file watcher can auto-load it immediately
- Never leave a newly created tool disabled unless the user explicitly requests that behavior
- Do not stop after writing files; finish only when the tool is created, enabled, and ready for use

## CRITICAL: Output Location

**ALL generated artifacts MUST be placed under `~/.flocks/plugins/tools/`.**

```
~/.flocks/plugins/tools/
├── api/                          # YAML HTTP/Script tools
│   ├── standalone_tool.yaml
│   └── threatbook/               # Provider group
│       ├── _provider.yaml
│       ├── ip_query.yaml
│       └── ip_query.handler.py   # Script handler (if needed)

│   └── my_tool.py
└── generated/                    # Auto-generated tools (hot-reloadable)
    └── virustotal.py
```

| Mode | Output Path |
|------|------------|
| YAML-HTTP tool | `~/.flocks/plugins/tools/api/{name}.yaml` |
| YAML-HTTP tool (Provider) | `~/.flocks/plugins/tools/api/{provider}/{name}.yaml` |
| YAML script handler | `~/.flocks/plugins/tools/api/{provider}/{name}.handler.py` |
| Provider config | `~/.flocks/plugins/tools/api/{provider}/_provider.yaml` |
| Python tool | `~/.flocks/plugins/tools/python/{name}.py` |

**NEVER** write to `flocks/tool/generated/`, `flocks/tool/`, or any other project source path.

## Mode Selection

| Criteria | A: YAML-HTTP/Script | B: Python |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| Simple REST API calls | **Yes** | **NO** |
| API with pre/post-processing | **Yes** (script handler) | **NO** |
| Tools sharing auth/base URL | **Yes** (Provider) | **NO** |
| Local utility (file ops, text processing) | No | **Yes** |
| Complex data transformation (no API) | No | **Yes** |
| Multi-step orchestration (no API) | No | **Yes** |

**Rule of thumb**: single HTTP endpoint → A; anything with logic and no external API → B.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: All external API integrations MUST use Mode A (YAML-HTTP or YAML-Script), NOT Mode B (Python).** This includes FOFA, VirusTotal, ThreatBook, Shodan, or any tool that calls a remote HTTP API. Only Mode A places files under `api/` which is required for the tool to appear as an API service card in the Web UI (Tools > API Services tab). If the API needs complex pre/post-processing, use `handler.type: script` (still Mode A). Mode B (Python) is reserved for tools that do NOT call external APIs (local utilities, data processing, etc.).

---

## Tool Description — "Outcomes over Operations"

**This applies to ALL modes.** The `description` field is how the LLM decides when to use the tool.

```yaml
# BAD: describes the API endpoint
description: "Call ThreatBook /v3/ip/query endpoint with an IP parameter"

# GOOD: describes when to use and what the agent gets
description: >
  Query IP threat intelligence including reputation score, geolocation,
  and associated threats. Use when analyzing suspicious IPs during
  security incident investigation.
```

### Bilingual descriptions for API services

For **API service integrations (Mode A under `api/`)**, always provide:

- `description`: English description
- `description_cn`: Chinese description

This applies to service-level metadata such as `_provider.yaml`, and also to metadata JSON files when the service uses that format. The Web UI uses `description_cn` for Chinese locales and falls back to `description` otherwise.

Recommended rule:

- `description` should be concise, natural English, focused on the service capability and use case
- `description_cn` should be a natural Simplified Chinese translation, not machine-like literal wording

Example:

```yaml
description: Threat intelligence service for IP, domain, URL, and file hash lookups
description_cn: 威胁情报服务，提供 IP、域名、URL 和文件哈希查询能力
```

---

## Adding Secrets

**This applies to ALL modes** that need API keys or credentials.

Add the secret to `~/.flocks/config/.secret.json`:
```python
from flocks.security import get_secret_manager
sm = get_secret_manager()
sm.set("threatbook_api_key", "your-api-key-here")
```

Then reference it:
- YAML handler: `{secret:threatbook_api_key}` in headers/params
- Python code: `get_secret_manager().get("threatbook_api_key")`

---

## Mode A: YAML-HTTP Tool

For declarative REST API integrations. One YAML file per endpoint, no Python code needed.

### Workflow

1. **Clarify requirements** — Ask only when key parameters are missing.
2. **Inventory the API surface first** — Read the official API reference / OpenAPI spec / sidebar nav and make a complete list of in-scope endpoints before writing files.
3. **Check if a Provider exists** — Look for `~/.flocks/plugins/tools/api/{provider}/_provider.yaml`.
4. **Create Provider (if needed)** — Write `_provider.yaml` with shared auth and base URL.
5. **Add secret (if needed)** — Add API key to `.secret.json` (see above).
6. **Write tool YAMLs for all in-scope endpoints** — Create `~/.flocks/plugins/tools/api/{name}.yaml` (or `api/{provider}/{name}.yaml`) until the inventory is exhausted, not just the first few endpoints.
7. **Run Verification Protocol** (see below) — MANDATORY.

### Endpoint Coverage Rule (CRITICAL)

When the user asks to "integrate an API", "build tools for X service", or similar, the default goal is **broad coverage**, not a minimal demo.

1. **Default scope**: if the user names a provider/product rather than a single endpoint, assume they want the API integrated as comprehensively as practical.
2. **Build an endpoint inventory first**: collect endpoints from the official docs, OpenAPI schema, endpoint tables, and doc navigation pages. Do not stop after the first matching page.
3. **Track every discovered endpoint**: each endpoint must end in exactly one state:
   - implemented as a tool
   - intentionally skipped with a concrete reason
4. **Allowed skip reasons**:
   - deprecated/legacy endpoint
   - duplicate alias of an already implemented endpoint
   - unsupported protocol (for example WebSocket/streaming-only)
   - dangerously destructive admin action not requested by the user
   - documentation too incomplete to build a reliable tool
   - clearly out of the user's requested scope
5. **Keep going until closure**: do not stop after "core" endpoints if the docs show more pages or endpoint groups. Continue traversing the API reference until all discovered groups are covered or explicitly skipped.
6. **Bias toward inclusion**: when in doubt between "install now" and "maybe later", prefer implementing the endpoint if the docs are clear and it fits YAML-HTTP/YAML-script mode.
7. **Respect explicit narrowing**: if the user explicitly asks for only one endpoint or one capability, follow that narrower scope instead of broad coverage.

### Endpoint Inventory Output

Before finishing the task, summarize the API surface briefly:

- Implemented endpoints/groups
- Skipped endpoints/groups with reasons
- Any doc sections that could not be accessed or were ambiguous

### Naming Consistency Rule (CRITICAL)

When creating API tools, keep the **tool name**, **YAML filename**, and
**script handler function name** aligned with the real API path semantics.

Rules:

- Preserve the endpoint wording from the path whenever practical. If the path
  says `report`, `reputation`, `sandbox`, `submit`, or `query`, keep that word
  in the tool/function/file naming instead of silently replacing it with a
  different synonym.
- You may add a small amount of extra wording for readability, such as a
  provider prefix or a clarifying suffix like `file_sandbox_submit`, but do not
  change the core path vocabulary.
- Prefer consistency across all three layers:
  - YAML `name`
  - YAML filename
  - script `function`

Examples:

```yaml
# GOOD: preserves path wording
name: threatbook_file_report
# file: threatbook_file_report.yaml
# function: file_report
# path: /v3/file/report

# GOOD: adds readability without changing endpoint vocabulary
name: threatbook_url_sandbox_submit
# file: threatbook_url_sandbox_submit.yaml
# function: url_sandbox_submit
# path: /v3/url/sandbox

# BAD: hides path semantics behind a different word
name: threatbook_file_query
# path is actually /v3/file/report

# BAD: tool says query but path is reputation
name: threatbook_url_query
# path is actually /v3/scene/url_reputation
```

### YAML-HTTP Format

```yaml
name: threatbook_ip_query       # snake_case, globally unique
description: >
  Query IP threat intelligence including reputation score, geolocation,
  and associated threats. Use when analyzing suspicious IP addresses.
category: custom
enabled: true
requires_confirmation: false
provider: threatbook

# Parameters — MCP-compatible JSON Schema (preferred)
inputSchema:
  type: object
  properties:
    ip:
      type: string
      description: IPv4 or IPv6 address to query
    fields:
      type: string
      description: Comma-separated fields to return
      default: "reputation,location,tags"
  required: [ip]

# Handler — MUST be type: http or type: script
handler:
  type: http
  method: GET
  url: "{base_url}/v3/ip/query"
  query_params:
    resource: "{ip}"
    lang: "en"
    fields: "{fields}"
  timeout: 30

# Response processing
response:
  extract: "data"
  error_mapping:
    401: "API key invalid or expired"
    429: "Rate limit exceeded, try again later"
    404: "No data found for this IP"
```

A simplified `parameters` list is also supported as sugar syntax:
```yaml
parameters:
  - name: ip
    type: string
    description: IPv4 or IPv6 address
    required: true
```

### Provider YAML Format

`_provider.yaml` is **required** for grouped tools. It serves two purposes: shared auth/base_url injection, and **triggering the API service card** in the Tools > API Services tab (for API key configuration).

```yaml
# ~/.flocks/plugins/tools/api/threatbook-cn/_provider.yaml
name: threatbook-cn
description: ThreatBook Threat Intelligence Platform
description_cn: ThreatBook 威胁情报平台，提供 IOC 查询与安全分析能力
auth:
  secret: threatbook_api_key
  inject_as: query_param         # header | query_param
  param_name: apikey
defaults:
  base_url: "https://api.threatbook.cn"
  timeout: 30
  category: custom
```

`_provider.yaml` description rules:

- `description` is required for English display
- `description_cn` should be added for Chinese display
- Both descriptions should explain the service capability and typical use case, not just repeat the vendor name

### Script Handler

For API calls requiring pre/post-processing that still benefits from YAML metadata:

```yaml
# ~/.flocks/plugins/tools/api/threatbook-cn/threatbook_cn_file_report.yaml
name: threatbook_cn_file_report
description: Query file hash threat intelligence from ThreatBook API
inputSchema:
  type: object
  properties:
    file_hash: { type: string }
    lang:
      type: string
      enum: [zh, en]
      default: en
  required: [file_hash]
handler:
  type: script
  script_file: threatbook_cn.handler.py
  function: file_report
```

Script (`~/.flocks/plugins/tools/api/threatbook-cn/threatbook_cn.handler.py`):
```python
from flocks.tool.registry import ToolContext, ToolResult

async def file_report(ctx: ToolContext, file_hash: str, lang: str = "en") -> ToolResult:
    data = await fetch_upstream_payload(file_hash=file_hash, lang=lang)
    return ToolResult(success=True, output=data)
```

### Response Fidelity Rule (CRITICAL)

For API tools, default to returning the upstream response data as faithfully as
possible.

Rules:

- Do **not** delete, collapse, or selectively keep only a few fields unless the
  user explicitly requests a reduced response.
- Prefer returning the raw `data` object, or the raw resource-specific object
  such as `data[ip]`, `data[url]`, or `data[domain]`.
- If you add convenience fields for compatibility or readability, they must be
  additive only. Do not remove or rename upstream fields in the process.
- If the API already returns structured JSON, keep that structure intact rather
  than flattening it into a hand-curated summary.

Examples:

```python
# GOOD
return ToolResult(success=True, output=data)

# GOOD
result = data.get(ip, {})
return ToolResult(success=True, output=result)

# BAD: lossy transformation
return ToolResult(success=True, output={
    "severity": result.get("severity"),
    "judgments": result.get("judgments"),
})
```

### IMPORTANT: Do NOT use YAML for non-HTTP tools

YAML-HTTP mode is **only** for REST API integrations. For local utilities, file operations, data processing, or anything that runs Python logic — use **Mode B (Python)** instead.

---

## Mode B: Python Code Tool

For tools that do NOT call external APIs: local utilities, data processing, multi-step orchestration, non-HTTP integrations, etc.

**⚠️ NEVER use Mode B for external API integrations (REST, HTTP).** Tools in `python/` do NOT appear in the API Services tab. Use Mode A with `handler.type: script` instead — it provides the same Python flexibility while keeping the tool under `api/` for proper API service card display.

### Workflow

1. **Clarify requirements** — Ask only when key parameters are missing.
2. **Add secret (if needed)** — Add API key to `.secret.json` (see above).
3. **Generate tool code** — Create `~/.flocks/plugins/tools/python/{name}.py` with `@ToolRegistry.register_function`.
4. **Run Verification Protocol** (see below) — MANDATORY.

### Python Tool Format

File: `~/.flocks/plugins/tools/python/{name}.py`
```python
from flocks.tool.registry import (
    ToolRegistry, ToolContext, ToolResult,
    ToolParameter, ParameterType, ToolCategory,
)

@ToolRegistry.register_function(
    name="my_tool",
    description="Example tool that does X. Use when the user needs Y.",
    category=ToolCategory.CUSTOM,
    parameters=[
        ToolParameter(name="query", type=ParameterType.STRING, description="Search query"),
        ToolParameter(name="limit", type=ParameterType.INTEGER, description="Max results", required=False, default=10),
    ]
)
async def my_tool(ctx: ToolContext, query: str, limit: int = 10) -> ToolResult:
    # ... implementation ...
    return ToolResult(success=True, output={"result": "..."})
```

### Tool Output Format
- **String**: `ToolResult(success=True, output="Done")`
- **Dict**: `ToolResult(success=True, output={"key": "value"})` — auto-serialized to JSON
- **List**: `ToolResult(success=True, output=[item1, item2])`

---

## Naming

- Tool names: `snake_case` (e.g., `threatbook_ip_query`)
- Provider names: `snake_case` (e.g., `threatbook`)
- File names: always `snake_case` matching the tool name
- Script handler files: `{name}.handler.py`

---

## Verification Protocol (MANDATORY)

**You MUST run these steps after creating any tool. Do NOT skip or defer.**

### Step 0: Metadata & Handler Audit (MUST run first)

This step exists because the loader silently accepts many degraded
configurations — invalid `category` is coerced to `custom`, missing
`type` on a parameter falls back to `string`, undeclared placeholders in
the URL substitute to an empty string, etc. By the time the smoke test
runs, the symptoms (404, "missing field", empty result) no longer point
back to the missing piece of metadata.

Run the bundled validator before anything else. It is self-contained
(stdlib + pyyaml only) and inspects the tool file *plus* its
`_provider.yaml` and any script handler:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(realpath ~/.flocks/plugins/skills/tool-builder)"
uv run python "$SKILL_DIR/validator.py" "$TOOL_PATH"
```

The validator checks (this list is enforced, not aspirational):

**Metadata (every mode)**
- `name` is present, snake_case, not colliding with a built-in tool
- `description` is present and long enough to be useful
- `category` is one of `file | terminal | browser | code | search | system | custom`
  — the loader silently coerces invalid values to `custom`
- `enabled: true` is set explicitly so the tool is active immediately
- For tools under `api/`: a `provider` field or a `_provider.yaml` is reachable

**Parameters / inputSchema**
- `inputSchema` or `parameters` is declared (not both)
- Every property has a `type` and a `description`
- Every name listed in `required:` is also defined in `properties`
- A required parameter never also has a `default`

**YAML-HTTP handler**
- `handler.type` is `http` (or `script`)
- `handler.url` is present
- Every `{placeholder}` in url / headers / query_params / body matches a
  declared parameter (or `{base_url}` when a `_provider.yaml` provides it)
- `response.error_mapping` keys are integers
- `{secret:xxx}` references are surfaced so you can confirm they exist

**YAML-script handler**
- `script_file` resolves to an existing file under `~/.flocks/plugins/`
- `function` exists in that file as `async def`
- The function signature accepts `(ctx, ...)` and every YAML parameter
  is either a named arg or `**kwargs`
- The script imports `ToolResult`

**`_provider.yaml`** (when the tool lives under `api/{provider}/`)
- File exists in the expected location
- `name`, `description` are present; `description_cn` is recommended
- `defaults.base_url` is set (otherwise `{base_url}` substitution silently
  produces `/path` and every request 404s)
- `auth.secret` and `auth.inject_as` are set when an `auth:` block exists

**Python tools (Mode B)**
- `from flocks.tool.registry import ...` is present
- `@ToolRegistry.register_function` is on at least one function
- The decorator carries `name`, `description`, `category`, `parameters`
- Every `ToolParameter(name=...)` matches an actual function argument
  (and the function is `async def`, with `ctx` as the first parameter)
- The function returns a `ToolResult(...)`

The output is a per-section report ending with
`Summary: N FAIL, M WARN`. **Do not proceed past this step until
`FAIL` is `0`.** Fix the file and re-run the validator. WARN items
should also be addressed unless you have a deliberate reason to leave
them — note the reason when reporting back.

For a CI-style check that fails on warnings too:

```bash
uv run python "$SKILL_DIR/validator.py" --strict "$TOOL_PATH"
```

### Step 1: Load Test

Attempt to load the tool into the registry to catch schema/handler errors:

A tool is not considered complete unless it can be successfully discovered, loaded, and registered by the tool system, not just written to disk or pass static validation.

**YAML-HTTP tools (Mode A):**
```bash
uv run python -c "
from pathlib import Path
from flocks.tool.tool_loader import yaml_to_tool, _read_yaml_raw

yaml_path = Path('$TOOL_PATH').expanduser()
raw = _read_yaml_raw(yaml_path)
tool = yaml_to_tool(raw, yaml_path)
print(f'PASS: Tool loaded successfully')
print(f'  Name:     {tool.info.name}')
print(f'  Category: {tool.info.category.value}')
print(f'  Source:   {tool.info.source}')
print(f'  Provider: {tool.info.provider}')
print(f'  Parameters: {[p.name for p in tool.info.parameters]}')
print(f'  Enabled:  {tool.info.enabled}')
if yaml_path.parent.parent.name == 'api' or (yaml_path.parent.name == 'api'):
    assert tool.info.source == 'api', f'FAIL: source should be api, got {tool.info.source}'
    assert tool.info.provider, 'FAIL: provider must be set for API tools (check _provider.yaml exists)'
    print(f'  API card: WILL appear in Tools > API Services tab')
"
```

**Python tools (Mode B):**
```bash
uv run python -c "
from flocks.tool.registry import ToolRegistry
import importlib.util, sys
from pathlib import Path

path = Path('$TOOL_PATH').expanduser()
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(f'_test_{path.stem}', str(path))
mod = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(mod)

tool = ToolRegistry.get('$TOOL_NAME')
if tool:
    print(f'PASS: Tool registered successfully')
    print(f'  Name: {tool.info.name}')
    print(f'  Parameters: {[p.name for p in tool.info.parameters]}')
else:
    print('FAIL: Tool not found in registry after import')
    sys.exit(1)
"
```

If load fails: **read the error, fix the root cause**, and re-run.

### Step 2: Smoke Test

Execute the tool with **safe, minimal test parameters** to confirm end-to-end functionality:

**YAML-HTTP tools (Mode A):**
```bash
uv run python -c "
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from flocks.tool.tool_loader import yaml_to_tool, _read_yaml_raw
from flocks.tool.registry import ToolContext

yaml_path = Path('$TOOL_PATH').expanduser()
raw = _read_yaml_raw(yaml_path)
tool = yaml_to_tool(raw, yaml_path)
ctx = ToolContext(session_id='test', message_id='test')

# Replace with actual safe test parameters
test_params = {$TEST_PARAMS}

async def run():
    result = await tool.execute(ctx, **test_params)
    print(f'Success: {result.success}')
    if result.error:
        print(f'Error: {result.error}')
    if result.output:
        output_str = str(result.output)
        print(f'Output: {output_str[:500]}')
    return result.success

ok = asyncio.run(run())
if not ok:
    print('WARN: Smoke test returned success=False (may be expected for auth errors with unconfigured API keys)')
"
```

**Python tools (Mode B):**
```bash
uv run python -c "
import asyncio
from flocks.tool.registry import ToolRegistry, ToolContext
import importlib.util
from pathlib import Path

path = Path('$TOOL_PATH').expanduser()
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(f'_test_{path.stem}', str(path))
mod = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(mod)

ctx = ToolContext(session_id='test', message_id='test')
test_params = {$TEST_PARAMS}

async def run():
    result = await ToolRegistry.execute('$TOOL_NAME', ctx, **test_params)
    print(f'Success: {result.success}')
    if result.error:
        print(f'Error: {result.error}')
    if result.output:
        output_str = str(result.output)
        print(f'Output: {output_str[:500]}')
    return result.success

asyncio.run(run())
"
```

### Choosing test parameters

- **HTTP tools**: use a real but harmless query (e.g., IP `8.8.8.8`, domain `example.com`).
- **Python tools**: use the simplest valid input that exercises the happy path. For destructive tools (delete, write), create a temp file first.
- If the tool requires an API key that hasn't been configured yet, the smoke test may return an auth error — that's **acceptable**. Report it to the user and note the tool structure is correct.

### Step 3: Report Results

After all steps, summarize to the user:

```
Tool created: {name}
  Mode: {A/B}
  Path: {file_path}
  Metadata & handler audit: {PASS/WARN/FAIL} — {N FAIL, M WARN}
  Load test: PASS
  Tool system registration: PASS
  Smoke test: {PASS/WARN/FAIL} — {details}
  Hot-reload: automatic (file watcher active — no restart or manual refresh needed)

{If WARN/FAIL, explain what the user needs to do (e.g., configure API key)}
```

---

## Failure Handling

- **YAML parse errors**: fix syntax before proceeding
- **HTTP handler errors**: check URL, auth config, parameter placeholders
- **Python import errors**: check imports, fix missing dependencies
- **Smoke test auth error**: expected if API key not configured — report to user
- **Wrong output path**: STOP immediately, move files to `~/.flocks/plugins/tools/{type}/`

## Pre-flight Checklist (mental, before writing any file)

1. Output path is under `~/.flocks/plugins/tools/{type}/`
2. **If the tool calls an external HTTP API → MUST be under `api/` (Mode A), NEVER `python/` (Mode B)**
3. Tool name is `snake_case` and unique (no collision with builtins: read, write, edit, bash, grep, glob, todo, question, plan, task, websearch, webfetch, codesearch, skill, etc.)
4. Description follows "outcomes over operations" style
5. Category is one of: `file`, `terminal`, `browser`, `code`, `search`, `system`, `custom`
6. Parameters have clear descriptions
7. For YAML-HTTP: `handler` section present with `type: http` or `type: script`, URL uses `{param}` placeholders
8. For Python: function signature matches parameter definitions exactly
9. Test parameters prepared for the smoke test
10. For API integrations: endpoint inventory completed; every discovered endpoint is implemented or explicitly skipped
11. Tool name / filename / function name preserve endpoint vocabulary
12. API tool output does not drop upstream fields unless the user explicitly asked for a reduced result
13. **Step 0 of the Verification Protocol (validator.py) was run and ended with `0 FAIL`** — every WARN is either fixed or explicitly justified in your report
