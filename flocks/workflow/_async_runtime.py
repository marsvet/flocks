"""Persistent background event loop for workflow-driven async calls.

Workflow code runs synchronously (engine + parallel node executor), but the
provider SDKs it invokes (OpenAI / httpx / anyio) expose async APIs and hold
loop-bound resources such as ``httpx.AsyncClient`` connection pools.

Previously every ``_run_coro_sync`` call spun up an ephemeral event loop via
``asyncio.run``. When the upstream server cut the stream short (e.g. 504 TTFT)
the OpenAI stream object retained a reference to the httpx client; once the
ephemeral loop was closed, later garbage-collection attempts to ``aclose()``
the hanging stream hit ``RuntimeError: Event loop is closed`` and dumped a
noisy (but functionally harmless) traceback on stderr.

This module provides a single, long-lived ``asyncio`` loop running on a
dedicated daemon thread. ``run_sync`` submits coroutines to it via
``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` and blocks on the returned ``Future``. Because
the loop never closes during the process lifetime, any late async cleanup
(stream ``aclose``, GC, etc.) always runs on a live loop.

Design notes:
    * Lazy initialization guarded by a module-level ``threading.Lock`` so
      concurrent first-callers cannot start multiple loops.
    * The backing thread is a daemon -> no explicit shutdown hook needed;
      it exits automatically when the interpreter tears down.
    * Calling ``run_sync`` from inside the dedicated loop's own thread would
      deadlock (``Future.result()`` would wait for a coroutine that can only
      run after the caller returns). We detect that case and raise instead
      of hanging, to surface mis-wired callers loudly.
