# Maximum characters of a skill's description shown in the `skill` tool's
# meta-description (the tool index that ships with the system prompt).
#
# Why a limit at all?
#   The `skill` tool's description is injected into every LLM call as part of
#   the tool schema. Listing the full SKILL.md frontmatter description (allowed
#   up to 1024 chars by `Skill._is_valid_description`) for every skill makes
#   the prompt grow linearly with the number of skills — and most of that text
#   is "how to use" detail that the model only needs *after* it decides to
#   load the skill.
#
# Why 500?
#   Empirically, the descriptions in `flocks/.flocks/plugins/skills/*/SKILL.md`
#   cluster between 60 and 614 characters; 500 chars preserves ~96% of the
#   total content (only one outlier needs trimming) while keeping the worst-
#   case cost of the index bounded. Critically, threat-intel/EDR skills tend
#   to put their hard constraints ("must load this skill before any X tool")
#   at the *end* of the description, so we keep both head and tail.
